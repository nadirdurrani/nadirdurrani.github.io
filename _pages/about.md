[QCRI](https://www.hbku.edu.qa/en/qcri) is a unique place that provides a flavor of industrial and acedamic research at the same time. I work at the Arabic Language Technologies ([ALT](https://alt.qcri.org/)) where I haved worked on several projects such as 

[Shaheen](https://mt.qcri.org/api)        [NeuroX](https://neurox.qcri.org/)

[NatiQ](https://tts.qcri.org/)            [Farasa](https://alt.qcri.org/farasa/).



Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
